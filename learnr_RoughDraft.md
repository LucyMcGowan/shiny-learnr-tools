`Learnr Package Rough Draft`

The learner software package can turn any R Markdown document into a collaborative multimedia solution for facilitating statistics and R programming tutorials. Building on R Markdown, the learnr package enables interactive tutorials featuring narratives, illustrations, figures, code snippets, code exercises, multiple-choice questions, videos, and other interactive shiny components. Users can access these interactive tutorials from their browser, via the same mechanisms as a shiny application. The code exercises created in the learner package display as R code blocks; the user can edit and execute them directly. Progress is automatically preserved, allowing users to save and keep track of completed exercises or questions. The learnr package supports interactive tutorials and includes built in tools for checking and reinforcing studentsâ€™ understanding while implementing a self-paced structure with instant feedback. The learnr package offers a platform where users are free to adjust code-snippets, complete coding exercises, read hints and solutions, and execute their code. In the context of this paper, we utilize the learnr package as a tool for hosting online experiments designed to examine best practices for teaching statistical or programming concepts.
