`Learnr Package Rough Draft`

The learner software package can turn any R Markdown document into a fascinating collaborative multimedia solution for teaching statistics and R programming. Building on R Markdown, the learnr package enables interactive tutorials featuring narratives, illustrations, figures, code snippets, code exercises, multiple-choice questions, videos, and other interactive shiny components. For example, the code exercises created in the learner package display as R code blocks, and the user can edit and execute them directly. There is no fear of losing accumulated hard work and progress when leaving the site in the learner-based tutorial. Automatically preserving work, tutorials allow users to save and keep track of progress on completed exercises or questions. After leaving, all the tutorial changes will save, so the user can continue to practice from the most recent changes. The learnr package supports teachers in creating interactive tutorials built with tools for “checking and reinforcing students’ understanding” while implementing a self-paced structure with instant feedback. The learnr package offers a platform where students are free to adjust code-snippets, complete coding exercises, read hints and solutions, and execute their code. In conclusion, the learnr package is a great tool to embrace modeling exercises as expedients to help other people learn something new using an interactive and self-paced platform.
