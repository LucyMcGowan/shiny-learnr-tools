Shiny App and Learnr Package:
================

### Tools used to create randomized trial

Creating a `short literature review` and `writing up methods` based on
modules used for a randomized trial that randomly assigns students to
the **tidyverse** or **base** modality for learning R.

-----

### Part One

    Shiny app and learnr package

**Research**

    Find papers where 
    
      i. a shiny app was used for a randomized controlled trial
      
      ii. research on conducting randomized experiments online 

**Write-up**

    i. Shiny- one to two paragraphs with citations
    
    ii. Learnr- one paragraph on the learnr package

-----

### Part Two

    Randomization and collection of data 

**Write-up**

    Tutorial style paper that walks through how to do the following steps
    
      i. Building Randomization in a shiny application
    
      ii. Using learnr to collect data
